UvsChess is a project designed to help students learn about artificial intelligence as it applies to the game of chess. The project is a framework that provides a graphical user interface for chess. The students use the provided interface to write their own AI. The students AI is in the form of a .Net assembly (.dll or .exe) that the framework loads and calls with each chess move.

The project is written in C#, and runs on top of the MS or Mono .Net runtimes. The GUI is written in System.Windows.Forms. The project also comes with an ExampleAI that shows how to use the interface and tie the AI project into the UvsChess Solution.

View the Wiki for information on how to download and compile the project.
